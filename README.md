# Generative Website

**Generative Website** is a pioneering experiment in generative web browsing—a new paradigm where the boundaries of the internet are redrawn by artificial intelligence. Our project explores the latent space of the so-called "dead internet," where content is not simply served from static files, but conjured in real time by large language models (LLMs) like gpt4.1-nano. Here, every web page is ephemeral, unique, and tailored to your intent, existing only as long as you need it.

## What is Generative Web Browsing?

Traditional web browsing is built on a foundation of static content—pages are written, hosted, and served to millions. In contrast, generative web browsing leverages the power of LLMs to create web experiences on demand, in a latent space that is both personal and transient. This is the "dead internet": a space where the web is alive, but only for you, and only for a moment.

With Generative Website, you can:

- Enter a prompt and instantly receive a fully-formed HTML page, generated by AI.
- Explore the possibilities of a web that is dynamic, ephemeral, and unconstrained by traditional publishing.
- Experience the future of browsing, where every session is a new creation.

## Why gpt4.1-nano?

At the core of Generative Website is **gpt4.1-nano**, a lightning-fast, cost-effective LLM that excels at generating the invisible tokens—HTML tags, CSS, and markup—that form the backbone of the web. Its speed and affordability make it the ideal engine for large-scale, generative applications, where responsiveness and low cost are essential. By focusing on markup generation, gpt4.1-nano enables us to deliver a seamless, real-time experience that is both accessible and scalable.

## Features

- **React + Vite** front-end with Tailwind CSS and a retro Windows 95 theme for a playful, nostalgic UI.
- **OpenAI integration**: Enter a prompt and receive a unique, AI-generated HTML page.
- **API key management**: Store your personal OpenAI API key securely in cookies via a simple setup bar.
- **Live preview**: Results are rendered in a CRT-style iframe with a toolbar and taskbar UI.
- **Dockerized deployment**: Effortlessly set up and deploy the project anywhere, from your laptop to the cloud.
- **Latent space browsing**: Every page is generated in the moment, existing only for you, and disappears when you leave.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Running in Development

```bash
cd generative_website_react
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server, typically available at <http://localhost:5173>.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized site is output to `generative_website_react/dist`. You can preview the build locally with `npm run preview` or deploy it to GitHub Pages using `npm run deploy`.

## Repository Structure

```
./generative_website_react   # React application source
./large_assets               # Image assets used by the site
./old project                # Legacy code (not used)
```

Explore the React source in `generative_website_react` to learn how the generator works and how LLMs can be harnessed for web creation.

## Vite Project Structure

The `generative_website_react` folder is a standard Vite + React project with the following key pieces:

- **Pages** (`src/pages`):
  - `Home.jsx` – main interface with the generator and API key setup.
  - `About.jsx` – project background, vision, and feature overview.
  - `Tos.jsx` – detailed terms of service and generative web disclaimer.
- **Components** (`src/components`):
  - `Navbar` and `Footer` provide the retro UI chrome.
  - `ApiKeySetup` stores the OpenAI key in a cookie.
  - `PageGenerator` sends prompts to ChatGPT and displays the result.
- **Routing** (`src/App.jsx`): `/`, `/about` and `/tos` routes are defined using React Router with a 404 fallback.
- **Libraries**: React 19, React Router DOM 7, Tailwind CSS 3, OpenAI SDK, js-cookie for persistence, and zod for schema validation.
- **Configuration**: Vite handles bundling (`vite.config.js`) and Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`), with deployment via the `gh-pages` script.

## Our Vision

We believe the future of the web is generative, not static. As LLMs like gpt4.1-nano become faster and more affordable, the line between user and creator will blur. The web will become a living, breathing latent space—one where every experience is unique, personal, and fleeting. Generative Website is our contribution to this vision, and we invite you to explore, experiment, and help shape the next era of digital creativity.
