<h2 class="post-title">Why Does the Sky Appear Blue?</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered why the sky appears blue during the day? Let's dive into the fascinating science behind it!</p>
<p>The main reason for the blue color of the sky is called <strong>Rayleigh scattering</strong>. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so they scatter the light in all directions.</p>
<p>However, shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) scatter more easily compared to longer wavelengths (such as red and orange). This is due to the relationship between the size of the molecules and the wavelength of light, as described by the Rayleigh scattering formula.</p>
<p>So, as sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue and violet colors are scattered in all directions by the molecules, creating the blue appearance of the sky. This phenomenon is also why the sky can appear red or orange during sunrise or sunset when the light has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere, scattering away the shorter wavelengths.</p>
<p>Isn't it incredible how such a simple scientific phenomenon can create such a beautiful and vibrant sky? Science never fails to amaze!</p>
