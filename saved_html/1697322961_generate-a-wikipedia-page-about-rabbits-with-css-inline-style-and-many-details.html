<p>Rabbits are small mammals that belong to the family Leporidae. They are known for their long ears, short tails, and powerful hind legs. Rabbits are found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and deserts, and they are native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Rabbits have a compact and rounded body shape, typically weighing between 0.5 and 2.5 kilograms. They have soft fur that can vary in color, including brown, gray, white, and black. Their long ears serve multiple purposes, including excellent hearing and regulating body temperature.</p>
<p class="italic">Did you know?</p>
<p class="highlight">Rabbits are herbivores, primarily feeding on grass, leaves, and vegetables.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Rabbits are known for their agility and ability to run and change direction quickly. They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. Rabbits are social animals and often live in groups called colonies or warrens. They communicate through various vocalizations and body movements.</p>
<p class="bold">Fun fact:</p>
<p class="highlight">Rabbits are notorious for their ability to reproduce rapidly. A female rabbit, called a doe, can produce several litters of offspring each year.</p>
<h2>Domestication</h2>
<p>Rabbits have been domesticated for centuries and are popular as pets due to their small size and gentle demeanor. Domestic rabbits come in numerous breeds, each with its own unique characteristics and appearances. They require proper care, including a balanced diet and regular veterinary check-ups.</p>
<p class="italic">Interesting fact:</p>
<p class="highlight">The world record for the largest rabbit is held by a rabbit named Darius, who measured 4 feet 3 inches long.</p>
<h2>Conservation</h2>
<p>While rabbits are generally not considered endangered, some species, such as the Riverine rabbit, face significant threats due to habitat destruction and hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these vulnerable rabbit species and their habitats.</p>
