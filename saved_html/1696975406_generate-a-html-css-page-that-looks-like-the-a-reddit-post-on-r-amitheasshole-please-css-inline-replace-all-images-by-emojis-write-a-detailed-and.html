We\'ve known each other for years, and we\'ve always had a good relationship. He\'s been going through some financial troubles lately and asked me to lend him a substantial amount of money.</p>      <p>I have always been careful with my finances, and I worked hard to save up this money. I didn\'t feel comfortable lending such a large sum, as it could put my own financial stability at risk.</p>      <p>I explained my concerns to John and politely declined his request. I suggested other alternatives like budgeting or seeking help from a financial advisor.</p>      <p>However, John got really upset and accused me of not being a true friend. He said I should prioritize his needs over my financial security.</p>      <p>Now, I\'m doubting my decision and wondering if I was in the wrong. Am I the asshole?</p>    </div>    <div class="post-footer">      <div class="post-actions">        <a href="#" class="emoji">üëç</a> 37        <a href="#" class="emoji">üëé</a> 12        <a href="#" class="emoji">üí¨</a> 23 comments      </div>      <div class="post-info">        <span class="emoji">üè∑Ô∏è</span> Category: Personal Finance      </div>    </div>  </div></body></html>
