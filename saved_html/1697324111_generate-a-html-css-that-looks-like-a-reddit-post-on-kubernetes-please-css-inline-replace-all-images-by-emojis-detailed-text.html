                Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment,
                scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google
                and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
            </p>
<p>
                With Kubernetes, you can easily manage and scale your applications without having to worry
                about the underlying infrastructure. It provides features such as automatic scaling, load
                balancing, and self-healing, making it suitable for deploying and managing applications in
                production environments.
            </p>
<p>
                Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to define the desired state of your applications
                using YAML or JSON manifests. It then continuously monitors the state of the cluster and
                ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.
            </p>
<p>
                The architecture of Kubernetes is based on a master-node model. The master node is responsible
                for managing the cluster and making decisions about the deployment and scaling of applications.
                The worker nodes, also known as minions, are responsible for running the actual application
                containers.
            </p>
<p>
                Whether you are running a single-node cluster on your local machine or a large-scale
                production cluster, Kubernetes provides a robust and scalable platform for managing your
                containerized applications.
