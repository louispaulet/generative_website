<div class="post-title">Am I the Asshole for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding?</div>
<div class="post-author">Posted by u/ThrowawayBride</div>
<div class="post-content">
<p>So, I'm getting married in a few months and I've been facing a dilemma regarding whether or not to invite my sister. Let me provide some context:</p>
<p>My sister and I have never had a great relationship. She's always been jealous of me and tries to overshadow me in every way possible. Throughout our lives, she has made snide remarks and undermined my achievements.</p>
<p>Recently, she crossed a line when she tried to sabotage my engagement. She spread false rumors about my partner, leading to tensions within our families. It caused a lot of unnecessary drama and stress.</p>
<p>Given her behavior and the impact it had on my mental health, I decided not to invite her to my wedding. I want to celebrate my special day surrounded by people who genuinely care about me.</p>
<p>However, some family members are pressuring me to invite her, saying it's the right thing to do. But I feel like I've put up with her toxic behavior for too long, and my wedding should be about happiness and love, not drama.</p>
<p>Am I the asshole for not inviting my sister to my wedding?</p>
