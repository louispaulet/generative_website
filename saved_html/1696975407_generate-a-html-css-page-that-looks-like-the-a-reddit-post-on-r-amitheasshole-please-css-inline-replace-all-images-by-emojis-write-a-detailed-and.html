My sister, let\'s call her Emily, has always been quite difficult to deal with. She\'s manipulative, constantly seeks attention, and has a habit of causing drama at family events.</p>        <p>Recently, Emily had a falling out with our parents and cut ties with them. My parents have been devastated, and it has caused a lot of stress for our entire family. The problem is, Emily expects me to take her side and exclude our parents from the wedding.</p>        <p>I\'ve always had a great relationship with our parents, and I don\'t think it\'s fair to punish them for Emily\'s actions. Our wedding day should be about celebrating our love, not about family drama. So, I made the difficult decision to not invite Emily to the wedding.</p>        <p>Now, she\'s furious with me and calling me a terrible sibling. Many of our mutual friends are saying that I\'m being too harsh and should consider inviting her to keep the peace. But I don\'t want our wedding day to be overshadowed by her drama. Am I the asshole for not inviting my sister?</p>      </div>      <div class="post-actions">        <button>ðŸ”º Upvote</button>        <button>ðŸ”» Downvote</button>        <button>ðŸ’¬ Comment</button>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
