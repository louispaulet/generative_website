They are one of the oldest reptile groups, having evolved millions of years ago. There are over 360 known species of turtles.</p>  <p>Turtles are found in various habitats such as oceans, rivers, and forests. They have adapted to live in different environments and have unique characteristics. For example, sea turtles have flippers for swimming, while tortoises have sturdy legs for walking on land.</p>  <p>These amazing creatures are known for their longevity. Some turtle species can live for more than 100 years. They have a slow metabolism and spend most of their time underwater or hiding in their shells.</p>  <p>Turtles play an important role in ecosystems. They help control populations of aquatic plants and animals and serve as prey for other species. However, turtles are also facing many threats, including habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal trade.</p>  <p>Let\'s protect and appreciate these fascinating creatures! <span class="emoji">🌍🐢❤️</span></p></body></html>
