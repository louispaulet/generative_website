        Cats have always fascinated humans with their exceptional night vision. But how exactly does it work? Can cats see in complete darkness, or is it just a myth?
      </p>
<p>
        According to recent studies conducted by researchers at Cat Science Institute, cats possess a unique ability to see in extremely low light conditions. While they can't see in total darkness, their vision is far superior to humans in dimly lit environments.
      </p>
<p>
        Cats' eyes are equipped with a layer of tissue called the tapetum lucidum, which acts as a mirror behind the retina. This reflective layer enhances their ability to gather and amplify incoming light, giving them a significant advantage in low-light situations.
      </p>
<p>
        Additionally, cats have a higher number of rod cells in their retinas compared to humans. Rod cells are responsible for detecting light, making them more sensitive to even the faintest of luminosity. This, combined with the tapetum lucidum, allows cats to navigate and hunt efficiently during nighttime.
      </p>
<p>
        While cats' night vision is remarkable, it's important to note that they still rely on some light to see. In pitch-black environments, their vision becomes limited, and they heavily rely on their other senses, such as hearing and whiskers, to navigate their surroundings.
      </p>
<p>
        So next time you see your feline friend effortlessly roaming in the dark, remember their incredible night vision capabilities!
