We used to be close friends, but recently our friendship has been strained. Emily has been acting distant and ignoring me without any explanation. It\'s been really hurtful and I don\'t know what I did wrong.</p>            <p>Now, my birthday is coming up and I\'ve decided to have a small gathering at our apartment. I\'ve invited all our mutual friends, but I intentionally didn\'t invite Emily because of her recent behavior. I wanted to celebrate with people who actually care about me.</p>            <p>However, when Emily found out about the party through our friends, she confronted me and accused me of being petty and excluding her on purpose. She said that I should have invited her regardless of our issues and that I\'m being unfair. Now I\'m starting to doubt myself. Am I the asshole here?</p>        </div>        <div class="comment">            <div class="comment-user">u/john_doe</div>            <div class="comment-content">NTA (Not the Asshole). It\'s your birthday party and you have the right to invite whoever you want. If Emily has been treating you poorly and ignoring you, she can\'t expect to be included in your celebration.</div>            <div class="comment-actions">12 points • 2 hours ago</div>        </div>        <div class="comment">            <div class="comment-user">u/jane_smith</div>            <div class="comment-content">YTA (You\'re the Asshole). While it\'s understandable that you\'re hurt by Emily\'s behavior, excluding her from your birthday party might escalate the situation further. It would be better to communicate with her and try to resolve the issues between you.</div>            <div class="comment-actions">8 points • 1 hour ago</div>        </div>        <!-- More comments... -->    </div></body></html>
