      Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield. They are among the oldest and most primitive groups of reptiles, having evolved millions of years ago.

      Turtles are known for their diet, which primarily consists of plants, such as algae, seaweed, and grass. However, some turtle species are omnivorous and may consume insects, fish, and even small mammals.

      Turtles have a unique body structure. Their shell is composed of an upper part called the carapace and a lower part called the plastron. The shell provides protection and support for the turtle's internal organs.

      Scientific studies have revealed that turtles can live for several decades, with some species living over 100 years. Their long lifespan is attributed to their slow metabolism and well-protected shell.

      Turtles reproduce by laying eggs on land. Female turtles dig nests and lay a clutch of eggs, which are then left to incubate. The hatchlings emerge from the eggs and make their way to the water, facing various challenges during their journey.
